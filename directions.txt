The ideal OS for Eiffel Vision 2 is a Windows machine for installation and usage.

https://www.eiffel.org/downloads
From this link, you will be able to download EiffelStudio, the IDE of Eiffel which allows you to compile & execute code.

Once set up, both programs will require Eiffel Vision 2 to use.
There is an add project option which once all files are downloaded and in a file, you will be able to select the folder and add
the file to your IDE. 

From there, you can compile up top and run the program both found in the toolbar.

Snowman Game:
For this game, both a drawing board and command line will display when executed. The game is initialized after several seconds
and played through the commandline. The drawings are prompted on wrong guesses and displayed in the white drawing board. This 
project requires an extra library that can be found in Tools, Add Library, and Filter for Time. (Pip Process too from I forget from Matt Keefe)

Creative Project:
This project will display an interactive GUI where you can add and remove employee objects created to show off the power of Eiffel
as an object-oriented language.
